        Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Gabriel Barrett. I'm 24 years old and I'm from Austin, Texas. I'm a full stack web developer with a passion for creating and learning new things. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, SQL/NOSQL, and React. 

        I'm a recent graduate of the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp. I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a developer. I'm currently working on a few projects and I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. In my off time I enjoy playing videogames, watching shows or movies, being outside in general, and spending time with friends and family. I'd be excited to work alongside you and your team on any projects you have in mind. Feel free to reach out to me through the contact page if you have any questions or opportunities for me. I look forward to hearing from you!
